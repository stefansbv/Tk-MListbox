    <td colspan=2>Modified bindRows(), bindColumns(), and bindSeparators() methods

    column index.<br>
    <i>This was done as a convenience. Usually, when binding to a widget, the first widget
    passed to the callback, has useful Event info. Not so in this case, because the first widget
    being passed back isn't the widget being bound to. The change was to include more information
    in a convenient package, and leave the door open for more info at a later time - RCS</i>

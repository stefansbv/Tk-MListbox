<h2>What is it and what is it good for?</h2>
<p class="pMargin">
   MListbox is a composite widget that's all about making  potentially complicated 
   tasks easier. It provides an easy way to implement tabular displays such as what 
   might be needed to display the result set from a database query, or a list 
   of files and directories. As it turns out, displaying data in columns is
   a common task, and there are other Tk widgets that provide similar functionality,
   and so much the better - choice is good. The different implementations each have
   their own strengths, and while there is a lot of overlap, some have features that
   the others don't. So what does MListbox offer?

<ul>
  <li>Is coded in perl - no worries about compiling and customization is bit easier</li>
  <li>Handles sorting, by pressing on column headers or by using the API. Further, it handles
      multi-column sorting by one or more keys. You can even create your customized sorting
      routines for a column.</li>
  <li>Handles manual column resizing</li>
  <li>Handles moveable columns. Users can reorder columns manually using drag and drop</li>
  <li>Provides the means to efficiently show or hide individual columns</li>
  <li>Offers a simple API - A majority of the methods should be familiar to Listbox users</li>
</ul>

<p class=pMargin>
  Currently, MListbox does have a few limitations - most of these limitations are directly
  because of Listbox. MListbox does not and cannot support several individually color rows -
  columns, yes, but not rows. The same holds true for fonts. Also, other widgets cannot be
  embedded into rows. Text justification is to the left only, and a single cells content can 
  only be displayed in a single line without wrapping. All these things, and more  can be 
  handled using Tk::HList should you require them.  Unfortunately, these other features come 
  at the cost of built-in sorting, resizing, moveable columns and a slightly more complex API.

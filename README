Tk::MListbox Module

Tk::MListbox is another "column" or "table" widget. It works much like a
Listbox, but in stead of storing each row as a scalar, each row in the MListbox
is a list or an array, each element in the list/array represents a column in 
the row. 

Tk::MListbox lets the user resize the columns by dragging a separator bar
between each column. The user might change the order of the column by dragging
the column headers. The data in the widget might be sorted by clicking one of
the column headers. A new click, and the sort order is reversed.

Tk::MListbox is designed for displaying reports like the result of a database
query or the contents of a directory.

Two example programs are provided: sql.pl lets the user enter a query and 
displays the result in a MListbox. Requires DBI.pm. filemgr.pl is a very 
simple file manager for unix.


To install, type

	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make install

MListbox.pm contains pod documentation.
